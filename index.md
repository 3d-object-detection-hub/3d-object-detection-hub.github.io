# 🎉 Welcome to the **3D Object Detection Hub**

This site was born out of a **Master’s thesis** effort to centralize and compare **every major 3D-OD method** using multiple sensor modalities. While many prior surveys focus on one sensor or era of work, here you’ll find:

> **A unified, searchable, and maintainable catalog**  
> covering camera-only, LiDAR-only, and multi-modal fusion approaches - all organized by **sensor** and **representation**.

If you use this site or data, please cite our publication:

## 🔗 Navigate

- 📊 [**Datasets**](/datasets/)  
  A concise table of the leading benchmarks (KITTI, nuScenes, Waymo, …) and their key properties.

- 🛠️ [**Models**](/3d-object-detection/)  
  A comprehensive database of published 3D-OD methods.  
  • **Filter** by sensor → representation  
  • **Search** for a method by name  
  • **Sort** by year, mAP, runtime, etc.

- 📚 [**References**](/references/)  
  The full bibliography of every paper, library, and dataset used to create this work.

- 👤 [**About**](/about/)  
  Background on the site, the underlying thesis, and contact details.

## 📖 Why This Hub?

Although 3D object detection has exploded over the last decade, existing resources often:

- ✔️ Cover only **one modality** (e.g. camera-only or LiDAR-only).  
- ✔️ Become **outdated** as new methods appear.  
- ✔️ Lack a **unified taxonomy** across sensors & representations.

**This Hub** aggregates:

1. **Multi-sensor methods** (monocular, stereo, multiview, point-cloud, voxels, fusion…).  
2. **Performance comparisons** across KITTI, nuScenes & Waymo.  
3. **Runtime metrics** to inform real-world feasibility.  
4. **Interactive filtering**, searching, and sorting.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find

### 📚 Datasets & Benchmarks
- **KITTI** – The foundational benchmark (2 cameras + 1 LiDAR) with 15 000 annotated frames.  
- **nuScenes** – Multi-modal data from 6 cameras, 1 LiDAR, 5 radars over 1 000 scenes.  
- **Waymo Open** – High-density 5 × LiDAR + 5 × camera over 1 150 segments and 230 000+ frames.  
…and more (ApolloScape, Argoverse, Lyft Level 5, H3D).

### 🛠️ Methods & Models
- **Monocular** (Mono3D, SMOKE, DD3D, MonoFlex, …)  
- **Stereo & Multiview** (LIGA-Stereo, Pseudo-BEV, …)  
- **LiDAR-only** (PointPillars, PV-RCNN, SECOND, …)  
- **Multi-Modal Fusion** (MVXNet, CLOCS, FUTR3D, …)  

Each entry shows **accuracy**, **inference time**, **paper link**, and **code availability**.
